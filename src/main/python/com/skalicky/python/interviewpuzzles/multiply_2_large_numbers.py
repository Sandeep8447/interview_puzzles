# Task:
#
# Given two strings which represent non-negative integers, multiply the two numbers and return the product as a string
# as well. You should assume that the numbers may be sufficiently large such that the built-in integer type will not
# be able to store the input (Python does have BigNum, but assume it does not exist).
#
# Here's an example and some starter code.
#
# def multiply(str1, str2):
#   # Fill this in.


def multiply_2_large_numbers(number_string1: str, number_string2: str) -> str:
